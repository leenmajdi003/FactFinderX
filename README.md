This model has been fine-tuned on a substantial dataset to effectively distinguish between real images and those generated by artificial intelligence. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, it has learned to identify subtle differences in patterns, textures, and features that are often overlooked by the human eye. The training process involved exposure to a diverse range of images, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across various scenarios. As a result, this model not only improves accuracy in classification tasks but also provides valuable insights into the characteristics that differentiate authentic content from AI-generated visuals. Its deployment has significant implications for digital content verification, enhancing trust in visual media.
